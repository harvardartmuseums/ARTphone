ARTphone
========
Call 1-617-500-1866 to listen to the Harvard Art Museums.

Read the blog post at http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/2013/object-phone/ for more information on the original idea and refer to https://github.com/cooperhewitt/objectphone for the original code. ARTphone is a rewrite (for the most part) of Object Phone in Node.js. Read more about this iteration of the project at http://magazine.harvardartmuseums.org/article/2014/04/24/calling-collections. 

If there is a better way to connect this repo to the main objectphone repo, let me know.

Usage
=====

Call the number to have some of the museums' stuff read to you.

Text 'about', 'random', or 'random person' to the number to get some info from the museums.
